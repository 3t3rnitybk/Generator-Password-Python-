# Python Password Generator with Special Symbols

This Python script generates random passwords containing:

- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Commonly accepted special symbols: 
`! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' < > , . ? /`

---

## How it works

- The script generates fixed-length passwords (default 10 characters).

- The passwords are written continuously to a text file named `passwords_continuous.txt`.

- Generation continues until the user manually stops the process (with Ctrl + C).
